If you mean the points_label folder in each category/class folder, then each line represents the part label/index for corresponding point in the points folder.

The dataset structure, take ShapeNet for example, should be something like this:
ShapeNet_root_folder

class 1 (e.g.: plane)
1.1 points (coordinates of points)
1.2 points_label (labels for corresponding points)
1.3 seg_img (part-segmented 2D images of class)
class 2 (e.g.: hand bag)
2.1 points (coordinates of points)
2.2 points_label (labels for corresponding points)
2.3 seg_img (part-segmented 2D images of class)
...
You can view the images inside each seg_img folder to clearly understand.
